## Contributing
We welcome contributions! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Commit your changes and push the branch.
4. Submit a pull request.

## Get Started
```bash
cargo add mechia-core
```

### Simple example:
```rust
use mechia::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent("gpt-4").build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt("Who are you?")
        .await
        .expect("Failed to prompt GPT-4");

    println!("GPT-4: {response}");
}
```
Note using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio's `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` features
or just `full` to enable all features (`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).

## Supported Integrations

Vector stores are available as separate companion-crates:

- LanceDB vector store: [`mechia-lancedb`](https://github.com/mechiacode/mechia/tree/main/mechia-lancedb)
